# R-Shiny-App-visualize-text-mining-analysis

This R Shiny application produces an analysis on the processing of a corpus from job boards available online. It is intended to guide the exploration and 
analysis of the corpus in a visual and interactive way. We chose to focus on the job offers available on the PÃ´le Emploi website. The objective is to analyse 
the body of text of the different offers present on the chosen site. We focused on one area in particular, namely job offers containing the word "data".
